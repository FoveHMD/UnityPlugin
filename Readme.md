# Fove Unity Plugin

Welcome to Fove Unity plugin source repository!

This repository is here for people who want to contribute or be able to easily trace the changes between versions. It also contains a few test scenes that can be useful to learn how to use the plugin or test that your plugin custom changes didn't break anything.
